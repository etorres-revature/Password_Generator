| NON-OBVIOUS | not information that is easily discoverable -- date of birth, anniversary, address, high school, etc. |
| UNIQUE | use one password for each account |
| MANAGER | use a service that auto-generates and stores strong paswords on your behalf in one centralized, encrypted location that only you can access with the master password |

### Technologies Used

#### HTML5

<p align="justify">
HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.  The goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices; and to remain backward compatible to older software.  Many new symantic features are included.
</p>

#### CSS

<p align="justify">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language (such as HTML5).  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content; including layout, colors, and fonts.  This separation improves content accessibility to provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enabling multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying relevant CSS in a separate file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content (HTML), as well as enabling the file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Separation of formating and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices.

#### Bootstrap 4

<p align="justify">
Bootstrtap 4 is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.  It contains CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

#### JavaScript

<p align="justify">
JavaScript(JS) is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (along with HTML and CSS). It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.  JS is a multi-faceted, scripting language that provides versatility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, among others.</p>
